# Amazing Grace

#### PD Info

## Verse 1
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me.  
I once was lost, but now am found,  
Was blind, but now I see.

## Verse 2
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,  
And grace my fears relieved.  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed.
